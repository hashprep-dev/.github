# HashPrep

HashPrep is an open-source platform designed to help users prepare for technical interviews by providing personalized study plans, coding challenges, and progress tracking. 

This repository contains the code for both the **frontend** (Next.js) and **backend** (Spring Boot) of the HashPrep platform. As the project is still in its early stages, we are actively planning the structure and defining the necessary features and frameworks.

## Current Status

- **Frontend**: The frontend is planned to be built with **Next.js**. The UI will include features like study plan dashboards, coding problem repositories, and progress tracking.
- **Backend**: The backend will be developed using **Spring Boot**, serving APIs to manage user data, track progress, and handle coding challenges.
  
At this moment, the project is still in the **planning phase**, and contributions are welcomed for feature suggestions, design proposals, and general project direction.

## Project Goals

- Build a user-friendly interface for technical interview preparation.
- Integrate with existing platforms like LeetCode and GeeksForGeeks.
- Provide personalized study plans and progress tracking.
- Include various interview-specific coding challenges.
- Allow community contributions and feedback to improve features and functionalities.
